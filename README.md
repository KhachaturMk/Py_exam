Description:

This is a console application for a touch terminal in a fast food restaurant. 
You can choose and pay for your order without waiting for a cashier. 
Spend the saved time on things that are more important to you.

After starting, the program will offer you to view restaurant menu, add product to order, 
remove last added product, view current order and pay it. The main startup file is main.py.

Object-oriented programming was used in the food_adn_drinks.py file. 
Menu objects were created based on the FoodAndDrinks class.

There is a report.csv file in the program. 
Details of paid and unpaid orders are recorded in this file.

The cashier has the opportunity, to check any order details using a unique order number. 
This is realized in check.py file, which must be installed on the restaurant employee's terminal.

There are two payment methods in the program, through TBC and BOG banks. 
You need to enter the IBAN account number, which conditionally consists of 10 characters. 
After some validation, you will see a message about successful payment.

Let's start ordering!
